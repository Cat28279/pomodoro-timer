# pomodoro-timer
I have created this app in PyCharm using the Tkinter package. It represents a Pomodoro Timer. You get 4 work sessions, 25 minutes long each, 
with 5 minutes breaks between them, and a 20 minutes break at the end. 

After each work session or break, you will hear a cute piano alarm to let you know that a work session/break has been completed.

Press Start to start the timer. Once all 4 work sessions are completed and the 20 minutes break ends, click on the Restart button, and then click Start
to use the Pomodoro timer again!
